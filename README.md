# Dog Breed Classifier

## Group Members
- Austin Vargason
- Klaudia Hernandez
- Brandon Arevalo

## Tasks
- Research Image recognition in Tensorflow (using Keras in Python)
- Analyze the dataset
  - in a jupyter notebook load in the dataset and figure out trends or issues in the provided set
  - handling the dataset the tensorflow (possibly normalize using an existing image recognition model)
  - make sure only dogs accepted
- Normalizing the Dataset
  - Look into possible feature reduction in the dataset
  - how to sort out different images (multiple resolutions, lighting conditions)
  - handling outliers (filtering or modifying)
- Design the model
  - parameter optimization
  - actual model structure (how many layers, etc.)
- Performance
  - google collab?
  - running on a GPU (CUDA)?
  - other general optimizations
